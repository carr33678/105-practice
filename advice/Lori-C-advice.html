                <h4>Be Prepared to Fail!</h4>
                <p>You will make mistakes. Many in fact. But without failure you cannot achieve success. Know that learning to code is a process. A long process but in the end a very rewarding result.</p>

                <p>Knowing that it is going to be a process, will help ease your anxiety and know that you are not alone! The good news is there are others that have been where you've been, so they can help you overcome the obstacles that come your way.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
